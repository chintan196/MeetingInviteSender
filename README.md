# MeetingInviteSender
This repository contains a small project (dotnet core 3.1) to send meeting invites to list of participants using Microsoft or Google as SMTP.
Meeting Invitations sent using this utility are parsed and displayed properly. I have verified this with Gmail Web and Outlook Web and Windows versions. 

This project also has logic to transform C# entity to any string content from C# Objects/Entities. - XSLT Transformation (This can be used to generate ICS Calender Invites and HTML Body for emails)

Meeting Template Reference: These templates are defined using reference from "Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification".
More details on the same can be found on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.2.17
I also added few properties to templates specific for Office365 and Google Calendar support.

Usage Note: Please note that for your meeting invitations to be displayed properly by clients (Gmail, Outlook) I suggest to use the same email (email address specified as User Name for SMTP) as an Organiser for the meeting, otherwise some client will not parse ICS correctly.
